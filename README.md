## Project Description
This system works on the fundamentals of feature extraction and similarity between vectors. The model extracts features from our image dataset and stores them into pickle files. Upon receiving an image, it extracts the features and compares them with all the images present in the dataset to recommend the most similar fashion items. This can be useful for fashion enthusiasts, e-commerce platforms, or anyone interested in visual similarity-based recommendations.
